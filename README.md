# Jobs-API Using NodeJS, ExpressJS and MongoDB
Simple API practice for a jobs like website 

Practiced and learned the following: 
- JWT
- Some Security (sounds fun)
- Error Handling (not good not bad) but clean
- Deployed it but useless without frontend  https://myjobs-api.up.railway.app/

To actually test it out 
- ```npm install```
- spin the server with ```nodemon app.js``` or ```node app.js```
- Use ```Postman``` or ```Thunder Client extension``` in vscode (much easier) and follow the routes, ``` /api/v1/auth/ <login or register> ``` for User authentication
``` /api/v1/jobs ``` for the jobs (also ```/api/v1/jobs/:<put the job id here> ``` to get a certain job).

Actually i should put some demo here...
